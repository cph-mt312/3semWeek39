# Week39

## Tuesday (+ small part of Wednesday):
#### The following exercises can be found in Tuesday - JPA demo
* **jpademo:**
    - I have watched all the video tutorials and coded alongside them (this includes adding/converting to DTO as shown in Wednesday's video)
      - Status of completion - 100%
## Wednesday/The rest of the week:
#### The following exercises can be found in Wed + Thursday - REST
* **restdto:**
    - *Part 1: Creating a REST API built on JPA Entities, a Facade, DTOs, and Tests*
      - Status of completion - *Nearly* 100% I'm missing a single test in PersonFacadeTest and I only managed to make a couple Rest Assured Tests
    - *Part 2: Error handling with JAX RS and ExceptionMappers*
      - Status of completion - I haven't made the red sections but other than that it's 100% complete, succesful testing w/ Postman
      - *Part 3: Extending the API to handle Entity Classes with relations*
      - Status of completion - Minus the red exercise it's 100% done
#### Pretty bummed I didn't have time to complete or even begin the optional exercise but I'll definitely give it a go sooner rather than later. I struggled a bit with the REST exercises but luckily it all worked out after some long hours. Might try to polish it a bit/try to complete some of the yellow/red exercises if I have enough spare time this weekend.
